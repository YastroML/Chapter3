The first column is the date in YYYYMMDD, the second is the date in Julian Date, the third is the R band Magnitude (Johnson Cousoins system), and the 4th are statistical errors of the magnitude (from the number of counts).

This source experienced several flares in the past six months. you can see this by using the .py file to do a quick plot. We would like to break this plot up into serveral other light curves to clearly show each flare seperately, so we can better understand them.
