How to contribute
-----------------

If you're leading a session, first you'll want to fork this repository, 
creating a new one tied to your Github account.  Then, just create a new
directory called "Session#" corresponding to whatever session we're on.
Put your ipython notebook and any data files necessary in there, and then use
git to commit those files. Then just ask one of the people with access to the
repository to merge it in, or you can issue a Pull Request from the Github web
interface.
